# 🗺️ Google Maps Setup - Simple Instructions

## ✅ **Dispatch Page Simplified!**

I've cleaned up the Dispatch page to show **ONLY** the Google Maps. All the extra content (stats, order lists, etc.) has been removed.

## 🔑 **To Get Google Maps Working:**

### **Step 1: Get Free API Key**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Click "Create Project" (or select existing)
3. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Library"
4. Search for "Maps JavaScript API" and enable it
5. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
6. Click "Create Credentials" → "API Key"
7. Copy your API key

### **Step 2: Add API Key**
1. Open the file: `frontend/.env`
2. Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key:
   ```
   VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyBxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```

### **Step 3: Restart Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 **What You'll See:**
- **Full-screen Google Maps** in the Dispatch page
- **Order markers** showing active orders
- **Click markers** to see order details
- **Real-time updates** as orders change

## 📍 **Current Status:**
- ✅ Google Maps component ready
- ✅ Dispatch page simplified (only map)
- ✅ Environment file created
- ⏳ **Just need your API key!**

Once you add your Google Maps API key, you'll have a beautiful full-screen map showing all your active orders with real-time tracking!
