# Google Maps Integration Setup

## ✅ **Google Maps Successfully Integrated!**

The Google Maps component has been successfully integrated into the Dispatch page (`/dispatch`). Here's what's been implemented:

### **Features Added:**
- 🗺️ **Interactive Google Maps** in the Dispatch page
- 📍 **Order Markers** showing active orders with details
- 🎯 **Info Windows** with order information when clicking markers
- 🔄 **Real-time Updates** that sync with your dispatch data

### **Setup Required:**

To enable Google Maps, you need to:

1. **Get a Google Maps API Key:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable the "Maps JavaScript API"
   - Create credentials (API Key)
   - Restrict the API key to your domain for security

2. **Add API Key to Environment:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` folder
   - Add your API key:
   ```
   VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Restart the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### **What You'll See:**
- A beautiful interactive map in the Dispatch page
- Markers for each active order
- Click markers to see order details
- Real-time updates as orders change status

### **Map Features:**
- **Center**: United States (adjustable)
- **Zoom**: Level 4 (shows entire country)
- **Markers**: One for each active order
- **Info Windows**: Order details on marker click
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

The map will automatically show markers for all your active orders and update in real-time as you manage your dispatch operations!

**Note**: Without the API key, you'll see a helpful message explaining how to set it up. The map will work perfectly once you add your Google Maps API key.
