## ✅ **Units with Drivers Now Visible on Map!**

The Dispatch/Map page now shows available drivers with their locations based on zip codes from the Units section.

### **Features Added:**

1. **🗺️ Unit Markers on Map**
   - Shows available units with drivers on the Google Map
   - Uses zip codes to determine exact locations
   - Custom truck emoji markers (🚛) for easy identification

2. **👨‍💼 Driver Information**
   - Driver name and contact details
   - Unit number and vehicle information
   - Current location and zip code
   - Available time windows

4. **🎯 Enhanced Map Interface**
   - Combined view of orders (📦) and available units (🚛)
   - Real-time counters showing number of orders and available units
   - Detailed info windows with driver and unit details

### **How It Works:**

1. **Units with Drivers**: Only shows units that have:
   - ✅ Assigned driver
   - ✅ Valid zip code
   - ✅ Available status

2. **Location Conversion**: 
   - Takes zip code from unit
   - Uses Google Maps Geocoding to get coordinates
   - Places marker at exact location

3. **Map Display**:
   - 🚛 **Truck markers** for available units with drivers
   - 📦 **Package markers** for active orders
   - **Info windows** with detailed information when clicked

### **Map Features:**

- **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes every 30 seconds
- **Interactive Markers**: Click to see driver and unit details
- **Smart Filtering**: Only shows available units with drivers
- **Location Accuracy**: Uses actual zip code coordinates
- **Visual Distinction**: Different icons for orders vs units

### **Driver Information Displayed:**

When you click on a unit marker, you'll see:
- **Unit Number**: e.g., "Unit 1"
- **Unit Name**: Vehicle make/model
- **Driver Name**: Full name of assigned driver
- **Location**: Full address from zip code
- **Zip Code**: Original zip code entered
- **Available Time**: When driver is available
- **Notes**: Any special instructions or notes

### **Example Usage:**

1. **Add Units**: Go to Units page and add units with drivers and zip codes
2. **Set Availability**: Mark units as "Available" in the Units section
3. **View on Map**: Go to Dispatch/Map page to see all available drivers
4. **Click Markers**: Click on truck markers to see driver details
5. **Plan Routes**: Use map to plan optimal driver assignments

### **Technical Implementation:**

- **Data Source**: Fetches from `/api/units` endpoint
- **Geocoding**: Uses Google Maps Geocoding API
- **Real-time**: Updates every 30 seconds
- **Performance**: Only processes units with zip codes and drivers
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles geocoding failures

### **Requirements:**

- **Google Maps API Key**: Required for geocoding functionality
- **Units with Drivers**: Only units with assigned drivers appear
- **Valid Zip Codes**: Units need valid US zip codes for location detection
- **Available Status**: Only "Available" units are shown on map

The map now provides a complete view of your fleet operations, showing both active orders and available drivers with their exact locations! 🚀
